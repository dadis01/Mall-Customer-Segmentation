Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning
 Project Description

This project explores customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques.
The goal is to group customers into meaningful clusters based on their age, annual income, and spending score, allowing businesses to improve their marketing strategies.

ðŸ“ˆ Results Summary

    KMeans Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models performed the best.

    DBSCAN was less effective due to uniform density in the dataset.

    Hierarchical Clustering provided good insights through dendrograms.

    Overall, unsupervised learning successfully revealed five customer segments.
